# Deep-Learning-Based-Semantic-Segmentation-with-PyTorch-and-ONNX
This project involves training and developing a deep learning-based semantic segmentation model using the PyTorch framework. Once the model is trained, it will be converted to the ONNX format. The converted ONNX model will then be used for inference with ONNX Runtime.
